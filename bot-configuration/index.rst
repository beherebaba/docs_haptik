Configuring and Deploying your Bot
==================================

The first page in this section outlines the Haptik bot builder tool's organizational hierarchy, which is what enables users to create complex bots and deploy them easily across multiple channels. This page also covers how to place your bot within the organizational hierarchy and make the most of the complexity that the bot builder tool provides. An awareness of how bots are organized is vital to understanding initial bot setup, so we recommend you read this before proceeding with your bot building. 

The next page in this section includes information about how to configure your bot deployment.

Finally, this section will cover how to configure permissions in the Haptik platform. Learn how to define groups that have access to certain platform tools and bots. 

However, if you want to go straight to the documentation covering the first steps of building your bot, jump to the `Bot Builder 
<http://www.python.org/>`_ section.
