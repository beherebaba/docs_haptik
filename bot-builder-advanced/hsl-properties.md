> You're viewing an older version of the documentation. Please visit the [new documentation](https://docs.haptik.ai/) for updated, comprehensive guides & resources on the topic

This doc will describe the various valid attributes and their values that can be used while generating the HSL jsons as and when applicable.

### HSL Data Attribute/Parameter Descriptions
 
The data part of the HSL holds most of the complex information enabling us to create complex chat elements. The data varies for every different type of the HSL. Before we dig into what all different data we could have, let’s quickly look into what actionables are how are they used along with different HSLs. Actionable is one of the most important part of the data is used heavily across all kinds of HSL.

### Actionable
 
Actionables exist to define both the existence & action of CTAs. Anatomy of an actionable object:
 
```json
{
    "actionable_text": "<text on the CTA>",
    "location_required": "<true or false>",
    "uri": "<URI>",
    "is_default": "<0 or 1>",
    "type": "<type of actionable>",
    "payload": {
        "link": "<link>",
        "gogo_message": "<message>"
    }
}
```


<table border="1" class="docutils">

      <tr>
         <th>Property Name</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>actionable_text</td>
         <td>This is the text shown on the actionable</td>

### Possible values for "type"
Like we have type of HSL, we also have type of an actionable. This type defines the nature of the actionable. The available types are:
<table border="1" class="docutils">
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Values</th>
         <th>Description</th>

### Keys of "payload" object
Actionable Payload is a dictionary which carries the meta-data required for the actionable to do it’s job.
Some of the keys used in this payload are:
