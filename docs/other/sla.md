title: SLA Agreement
---

We guarantee that 99.9% of the time the Covered Service will successfully receive and respond to API requests on the production environment.

The following definitions apply to the SLA:

- **"Covered Service"** means Haptik's end user chat experience. Bot Builder, Analytics and other development tools are not covered under this SLA.
- **"Downtime"** means more than a 5% Error Rate. Downtime is measured based on server side Error Rate.
- **"Downtime Period"** means a period of one or more consecutive minutes of Downtime. Partial minutes or Intermittent Downtime for a period of less than one minute will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods.
- **"Error Rate"** means the number of Valid Requests that result in a response with HTTP Status 500 and Code "Internal Error" divided by the total number of Valid Requests during that period.
- **"Monthly Uptime Percentage"** means total number of minutes in a month, minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime Periods in a month, divided by the total number of minutes in a month.
- **"Valid Requests"** are requests that conform to the Documentation, and that would normally result in a non-error response.
