Agent Interface
===============

Chat Solutions at Haptik can be powered entirely by Artificial Intelligence(AI) or by a combination of AI and Chat Agents.

Chat flows are built by the Haptik product team to best cater to the needs of the client and the solution being deployed. Chat flows are designed to guide the user through a specific problem and are the most important factor to ensure the best experience for all users.

In case a bot is unable to respond to a query which is outside the chat flow, the chat is handed over to a chat agent. Agents receive and send message over an web based tool called Athena. Athena has the same capabilities of the AI along with additional functionality for smooth operational deployment such as monitoring, review, assignment of chats by managers etc.

Assistants can be assigned 3 chats at a time. Below is the image for the same.
